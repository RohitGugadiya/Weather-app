# Weather App (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API Integration)

## Project Overview 

  Developed a fully functional Weather Application that allows users to view real-time weather forecasts based on their location or a city of their choice. The app integrates a third-party 
  weather API to fetch live data, displays it in a user-friendly interface, and offers features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

## Technologies Used

  Frontend: React, HTML5, CSS3
  
  API Integration: OpenWeatherMap API (or any relevant weather API)
  
  JavaScript: DOM manipulation, asynchronous operations (fetch/async-await)
  
  State Management: React useState and useEffect hooks for dynamic data rendering
  
  Styling: CSS for responsive layout and visual appeal 

## Key Features

Display of current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

Search functionality to get the weather of any city globally.

Dynamic background and styling based on weather conditions for enhanced user experience.
Error handling for invalid city searches and API request failures.
